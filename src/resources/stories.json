In the Galerie you can find two dogs. They are from my host, she let me walk them out once in a while. The best thing about Barcelona is probably the good weather, the beach and the fun community. I might consider Barcelona for another visit one day."

Soulac might have the best beaches, however the water is chilly most of the year. France is probably best for it's food. I enjoyed the crossants and the restaurant food a lot!"

After finishing lessons around 6am in the morning I slept for just a short while before starting my descovery around LA. At that time the buses were free and they took me to the mountains and the beach. Also I celebrated my 28th birthday. You can see a picture of the club in the Galerie."

      "text": "In 2022 I went to Istanbul with a friend. We were mostly busy with the sightseeing. We booked a hotel in the center and went out with ferries or cabs. The food is impressive, just as the architecture and the people. On the east side we encountered a more lively area of Turkey. Here we found hippy bard, meetups and clubs. Istanbul was certainly worth its while. I will remember Turkey for its flavours, The best part was a Paulaner beer right in front of a VW KÃ¤fer."
