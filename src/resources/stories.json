This is a district east of Lima, it's one of the more famous parts of Lima. There are several tourist destinations for sightseeing with a shopping center close to the ocean. Some people go surfing during the winter months, altough the sea is rough with a strong wind."

      "text": "In 2022 I went to Istanbul with a friend. We were mostly busy with the sightseeing. We booked a hotel in the center and went out with ferries or cabs. The food is impressive, just as the architecture and the people. On the east side we encountered a more lively area of Turkey. Here we found hippy bard, meetups and clubs. I will remember Turkey for its flavours, The best part was a Paulaner beer right in front of a VW KÃ¤fer."
